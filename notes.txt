Servers:
- Stripped Down to the bare min (no second psu, no mgt interface)
- Preinstalled windows (with Apple123 default password)
- LOUD! pushing 70db at full fan speed
- Memory installed in the wrong slots
- RAID 1 for SAS drives included

Host OS:
- Starightforward Ubuntu install

OpenStack Package Instal from Tarball:
 - Tarball issues:
  - Binary deps for tarballs
    - advertise bindep.txt and how to use it
    - not all projects use bindep for everything
  - python packaging etc files, need to copy etc/ from tarball into created /etc/$service dir
    - always use upper-constraints!!!
  - no service files (systemd unit files) had to write my own

Keystone:
  - Install docs:
    - create 3 endpoints for each service (not really needed)
    - recommends mod_wsgi but keystone docs say uwsgi (probably because of packaging)

  - Fernet expects service user (need to create it)
  - apache2 setup not specified anywhere in install docs (ubuntu does it for you)
  - google keystone in apache on how to do it yields:
    https://docs.openstack.org/developer/keystone/apache-httpd.html

  - requirements conflict
    - solved with manual resolution, copying oslo.policy requirement for requests
      and manually installing it, fixed with reordering requirements file: oslo.policy before
      keystoneclient (pip no dep solver)
  - warning with default paste.ini, docs explain it but it says removed in O and I installed O... (also it's never used)

Glance:
  - Store is misconfigured error:
    - Make sure store dir exists (requires restart to take)

Nova Controller:
  - Conf docs say `use_neturon` defaults to false but it doesn't. Install guide
    explicitly sets it
  - firewall driver confusing from sample config
  - Make sure you create lock dir and it has proper permissions
  - 'nova' databse migrations is slow took ~3mins
  - Don't forget the placement API. A wsgi script, not a standalone service
    - Docs for deploy of placement aren't straightforward enough, need to google
      how to deploy mod_wsgi script. Sample configs would be useful like what
      keystone does. I used keystone's docs and samples as a reference.
  - Permission error on keys dist-packages
    -set state_path and keys_path per:
       https://bugs.launchpad.net/openstack-manuals/+bug/1457423
  - sudoers file for rootwrap:
    https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1421597
  - version conflict because of pip fun
  - novnc
    - ubuntu package is built improperly and depends on nova
    - didn't run novnc for now

Nova Compute:
  - need to specify nova compute driver
  - install libvirt python bindings
  - libvirt permission issue
    - add service user to libvirtd group
  - placement api not responding
    - make sure you type endpoints in correctly (compute != altocumulus01)

Neutron:
  - Linux Bridge Provider Networks
  - Too many config files, no idea what's going on (just blindly copying and pasting)
     - I had to look at packages to figure out how this worked there
  - rootwrap and sudo is a mess
    - need 2 commands in sudoers file
    - need to set rootwrap commands in config (not in docs)
      https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/1182616
    - state dir
    - lockpath linuxbridge agent
    - install conntrack
  - Failure mode for missing execs is sooo bad:
    - http://paste.openstack.org/show/604877/ <- Missing ipset
    - https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/1677742

Nova Compute (at instance launch time)
  - libvirt/nova-compute unable to open image backing file in instances dir
    - apparmor (do not install the virtualization group in the ubuntu installer)


Booting guests
 - First guest boot no connectivity
   - Checking network with tcpdump show vm interface on bridge seeing arp
     requests for ip owner, guest doesn't respond though
   - Images are blank
     - Uploaded glance image was blank, but nothing failed
       - tcpdump showed all the bits but glance didn't see anything (inserted
         debug statements into glance code)
       - it was a requirements conflict reinstalling deps with upper constraints
         fixed it
   - Using an ubuntu guest works. Cloud init wasn't picking up static ip setting
     so it doesn't respond to arp.
     - dhcp to physical network blocked by security groups (I think)


compute node setup process:
  - add provider interface config
  - disable apparmor
  - reboot
  - download tarballs
  - create system users
  - add nova user to libvirt group
  - install all binaries (libvirt, qemu, ipset, mkisofs, libssl-dev, pip)
  - make service dirs /etc/ /var/lib
  - copy etc dirs from tarballs to /etc
  - pip install code with upper-constraints
  - write config files
  - set permissions on /etc and /var/lib
  - create sudoers files
  - create systemd unit files
  - start services
  - run nova discover_hosts
